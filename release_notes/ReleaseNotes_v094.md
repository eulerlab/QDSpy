## 0.94beta (February 2025)  
- Some bug fixes:
  - Allow using file paths that contain spaces
  - Log file path joining fixed in `QDSpy_GUI_main.py`
  - `QDSpy_checks.py` disabled - caused errors (?)
  - `QDSpy_core_shader.py`: fix joining paths
  - `Freeze `moviepy` package to version <2 because of breaking changes
  - In `QDSpy_core.py`, use `sys.executable` instead of `"python"`, because this ensures that Python is call within the current virtual environment 
  - More path joining bugs fixed
  - Now writes log file continuously, such that it is not lost when QDSpy crashes. If necessary, the previous behaviour can be restored by setting `QDSpy_saveLogInTheEnd` in `QDSpy_global.py` to `True`.
  - `hid` package for Python 3.13 added
